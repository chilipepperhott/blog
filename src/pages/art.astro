        Below you'll find a small interface for some generative art algorithms
        that I've made.
      </p>
      <p>You can find most of the source code in this repository.</p>
      <p>
        Note that this is a very old project. I learned a lot from it, but be
        warned that it isn't very performant.

        To begin, select an algorithm below. You can also load your own image to
        toy around. Don't worry, all this runs in the browser so your data is
        safe. To download the highest quality result, use the buttons at the
        bottom to download either a SVG or a PNG.

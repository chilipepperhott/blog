# Naming Harper

[Someone](https://github.com/elijah-potter/harper/issues/103) recently asked me where the name [Harper](https://writewithharper.com) came from.

When I first sat down to start work on Harper, I had one goal in mind.
I wanted to create a grammar checker that wouldn't impinge on the artistic freedom of authors.
Part of that meant that I did not want literary devices to be flagged as grammatical errors.
Harper should speed up the writing process rather than slow it down as Grammarly tends to.

To embody this original goal, I wanted to make the project a namesake of an author known for their literary devices and prose. I also had three other (practical) criterion:

1. It could not be occupied on [crates.io](https://crates.io/).
1. It could not be occupied on GitHub.
1. It should not be more than two syllables.

I asked around for some ideas and someone suggested I name the project after [Harper Lee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harper_Lee).
It fit the bill, so I went with it.

# The Three Steps to an Apology

My grandmother is a wonderful woman. She never leaves the house without a least a little bit of purple. Maybe a keychain or a purse. Sometimes, she wouldn't leave the house without a lot of purple, head to toe. She also never forgets a smile and a good attitude.

She's a wise woman. With more than 70 years and five children under her belt, she's seen some stuff. All that experience comes with a lot of advice. The three steps to an apology are some of the best bits of advice she's ever given me.

## Step One: "I am sorry"

Admit you've done something wrong. Recognize your fault and imagine what would have happened if you had done the right thing.

## Step Two: "It will not happen again"

If you're actually sorry, you'll want to avoid replicating the same mistake at a later date. Figure out what you need to do to make sure you this is a one-time error.

## Step Three: "What can I do to make it better?"

Attempt repair. In a fantasy world, you could go back in time and stop yourself from doing whatever it is you did in the first place. But we don't live in a fantasy world, so you have to find a way to make it right, as soon as possible.

# The Best 25 Bucks I Ever Spent

Earlier this year (I don't remember the exact day or month) I decided, screw it, I'm going to try using a flip phone.
For years I've wondered what it was like before the information revolution, but [as a Zoomer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generation_Z), I've never had the opportunity.

I got the cheapest Verizon-compatible flip phone Amazon had to offer and I committed myself to using it exclusively for at least a week.
A week without the entirety of human knowledge in my pocket.
A week of using my voice to communicate, rather than a touch-screen keyboard.

Beside two factor authentication for GitHub, that first week was a breeze.
I found myself socializing more, since it turns out that most people in my social circle are just a phone call and a 10-minute walk away.
I also found myself reading better quality literature.
Rather than resorting to HackerNews to ease my boredom, I began devouring full books at a frightening pace.
That first week turned into two, then four, then twelve.
All the while, I was proving to myself that I didn't need a smartphone.

For a number of reasons, I'm back to using a smartphone.
But this experience has taught me some important lessons that I don't think can be taught any other way.

**Organizing social encounters over text just doesn't work.**

Some people don't check their phone too often.
Calling them make it clear that their participation is important to you.
This may sound trivial or obvious to some of the older members of my audience, but to pretty much every Zoomer I've talked to about this, it is a revelation.

**Quiet is sacred, and should be protected.**

I see loads of people who walk around every day with their headphones in, barely paying attention to the music blaring out of them.
I've done this myself.
It closes you off the world.
From the tapping of water off an icicle.
From the shaky but warm greeting from a colleague.
From the chortling roar of an engine.

But most of all, it closes you off from your own mind.
The best thinking and imagining happens in the quiet, when your brain has nothing more stimulating to do.

Overall, using a flip phone was a very quieting experience.
It helped the world feel larger and more magical.
